          Marketing data is everywhere, but making sense of it? That’s where the real magic happens. I design data
          solutions that don’t just collect information—they connect the dots between marketing efforts and real revenue
          impact. By transforming raw event data into actionable insights, I’ve helped businesses optimize user
          journeys, sharpen lead qualification, and make smarter decisions. These case studies are a glimpse into how
          data engineering can bridge the gap between marketing and sales, turning insights into measurable growth.
