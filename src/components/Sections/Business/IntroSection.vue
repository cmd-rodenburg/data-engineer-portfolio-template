            Data is everywhere, but making sense of it? That’s where the real magic happens. I design data
            solutions that don’t just collect information—they connect the dots between marketing efforts and real revenue
            impact. By transforming raw event data into actionable insights, I’ve helped businesses optimize user
            journeys, sharpen lead qualification, and make smarter decisions. These case studies are a glimpse into how
            data engineering can bridge the gap between tech and business, turning insights into measurable growth.
